# Project Overview
The project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a loan application will be approved based on various applicant details and financial metrics. 
The objective is to analyze and use historical data on previous loan applications, including attributes like income, loan amount, and applicant demographics, to identify key patterns that influence loan approval decisions. 
By building an accurate prediction model, the project seeks to streamline loan approval processes and support financial institutions in making data-driven decisions.

# Motivation
Loan approval decisions play a critical role in financial services, impacting both individuals' access to credit and lenders' risk management. 
Automating the loan approval process with a reliable predictive model can lead to faster decision making, risk mitigation and enhanced financial inclusion.
Through this project, we explore various machine learning techniques to build a robust model that can classify loan applications as "Approved" or "Rejected" with high accuracy, benefiting both lenders and applicants.
